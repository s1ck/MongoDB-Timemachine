This project is an evaluation of MongoDB for a usecase where time series
data (up to 30M measuring points) has to be stored and queried. 
Queries are simple range queries (from - to timestamp) and simple filters,
like "all data from station x" or "all days where x was greater then y".

This is my first trial with MongoDB and I hope it will fulfill our needs :)
